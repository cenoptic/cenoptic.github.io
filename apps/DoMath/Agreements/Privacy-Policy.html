    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Cenoptic (the "DEVELOPER") built the "Do Math" game as an ad supported game (the "SERVICE"). This Privacy Policy (the "POLICY") refers to anyone who uses the SERVICE as "YOU". To provide YOU with the full range of features and functionality within the SERVICE, the DEVELOPER uses a number of third-party providers (the "THIRD-PARTIES"). By using the SERVICE, this POLICY automatically applies to you.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Information about YOU may be used by the SERVICE or its THIRD-PARTIES. If YOU choose to use the SERVICE, then YOU agree to the use of that information as described in this POLICY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DEVELOPER does not directly collect or store any information about YOU on its servers. However, the SERVICE may use THIRD-PARTIES, which may collect, use, and store certain information about YOU on their servers. These THIRD-PARTIES have their own privacy policies and the DEVELOPER has no control over their practices. By using the SERVICE, YOU acknowledge and agree that information about YOU may be collected, used, and stored by these THIRD-PARTIES in accordance with their respective policies. We encourage YOU to review the privacy policies of these THIRD-PARTIES to understand how they handle this information.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>THIRD-PARTIES</strong></h2>

    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Ads</strong></h3>
    <p>The SERVICE uses the Google AdMob SDK, which may use certain information about YOU to provide personalized ads or non-personalised ads.</p>
    <h2><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Under 18</strong></p>
    <p>
      This POLICY does not address anyone under the age of 18. If YOU are under 18, YOU must not use the SERVICE. You must be at least 18 to consent
      to this POLICY.
    </p>    
    <p><strong>Advertising Consent</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each time you launch the SERVICE, YOU can specify how YOU would like to receive ads. If at any time YOU wish to change the consent YOU have given us, YOU can relaunch the SERVICE to do so.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Admob Consent</strong></p>
    <p>
      YOU can choose how you receive ads. There are two ways to do this:

    <p><strong>Changes To This POLICY</strong></p>
